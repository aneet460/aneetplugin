Hello, thank you for downloading Aneet's Social Media Widget. 

Once you download the widget, head to the tab Plugins on your Dashboard. 

There you'll see the name of this plugin, click activate. 

Now that you have activated your plugin, you can go to the Widgets tab and drag the widget into your category of choice. Doing this will display buttons for your Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn accounts.

Another use for this widget is to use the builtin shortcodes. 

In your post or page, you can insert individual social media buttons, including a custom link to your social media account. 

To do so, click to edit a post or page of your choice, and insert the following code to your content: 

* facebook: 
[buttonfb link="facebook.com/youracount"]

*instagram
[buttonig link="instagram.com/youraccount"]

*linkedin
[buttonli link="linkedin.com/youraccount"]

~~Advanced~~ 

If you'd like to change a button to a different social media site, you have the option to change: the colour of the button, the text on the button, and the link. 

E.x. 
changing the facebook button to a twitter button: 

[buttonfb link="twitter.com/youraccount title="Twitter" buttoncolor="#55acee"]

Doing this will change your button from reading "Facebook" to "Twitter" and redirect the clicker to your twitter account. The button colour was changed to match the twitter icon colour. 

Now you're ready to use this plugin. 
Enjoy.
